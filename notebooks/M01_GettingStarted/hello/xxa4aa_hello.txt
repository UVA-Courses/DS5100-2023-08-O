Hello, my name is Aidan Herzig.

The movie I watched most recently (that I enjoyed) was Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse. I didn't love the way they handled the ending, but I thought it was hilarious and had very powerful moments thorughout the first 2 acts. First one is still my favorite movie though.
