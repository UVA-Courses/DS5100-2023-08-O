My name is Aziza Aripova.
I have recently watched the movie “Django Unchained” uncovering the story of the violence and inhumanity of white American people over the Afro-American population.
The whites treated black people worse than slaves allowing themselves awful and cruel acts even killing them for no lawful reason. 
The attitude of the non-slave was horrible and sickening, no man on earth deserved such treatment despite their race or skin color. 
It was to such an extent that death was a blessing for the enslaved. Django got lucky that he was saved by a so-called dentist who was a bounty hunter. 
Django was a very smart, brave, and loving person ready to do anything to save his wife. 
He went through many challenges, but in the end, he managed to rescue his beloved one. However, he lost his dear friend Dr. Schultz in this fight.
